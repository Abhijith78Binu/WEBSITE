               <h3>Is There a Handicap System in Place?</h3> 
           </div>

              <div class="content1"><p>A thorough handicap system is used at our golf club, which is necessary to foster a level playing field among players with different ability levels.
                In order to ensure that handicaps accurately reflect each golfer's potential ability, this approach computes handicaps based on players' most
                 recent scores as well as the relative difficulty of the courses played. Members may easily track and enter new scores with our mobile app
                  and website, which both provide frequently updated handicaps. This technique helps with personal skill improvement in addition to leveling 
                  the playing field and improving game enjoyment and equity. It is an essential instrument that embodies our dedication to fairness and the 
                  integrity of the sport, suitable for recreational play as well as fulfilling tournament participation requirements.</p></div>
